Hi! I am Siteng Huang (黄思腾 in Chinese). I am a joint Ph.D. student of [Zhejiang University](http://www.zju.edu.cn/) and [Westlake University](https://www.westlake.edu.cn/), advised by Dr. [Donglin Wang](https://en.westlake.edu.cn/about/faculty/201912/t20191206_2513.shtml). And I am a member of [Machine Intelligence Laboratory (MiLAB)](https://milab.westlake.edu.cn/) in Westlake University, where I do my research work on machine learning and robot learning. Currently, I am also a research intern at <a href="https://damo.alibaba.com/" target="_blank">DAMO Academy, Alibaba Group</a>. I received my B.Eng. Degree from School of Computer Science, [Wuhan University](https://www.whu.edu.cn/) in 2019.

<!-- Before coming to Westlake University, I obtained my bachelor's degree of Engineering from School of Computer Science, [Wuhan University](https://www.whu.edu.cn/), majoring in Software Engineering. -->

<!-- I am **seeking research intern opportunities in 2022** for solving challenging research problems in the domain of data-efficient learning. Please refer to my [CV (Chinese)](https://kyonhuang.top/files/SitengHuang-CV-cn.pdf) and feel free to drop me an email if you are interested! My email address is `huangsiteng [at] westlake.edu.cn`.

## Research Interests

<!-- I am interested in technologies that allow machines and robots to learn like humans. In particular, I am committed to giving robots the ability to understand the world and learn from previous experiences, so that they can complete new tasks, acquire new skills or adapt to new environments rapidly with fewer samples through learning algorithms. Currently, my areas of interest include meta-learning, multi-task learning, and transfer learning on few/zero-shot learning tasks. I am also interested in deep learning, computer vision, and multimodal machine learning. -->

In particular, I am committed to giving robots the ability to understand the world and learn from previous experiences, so that they can complete new tasks, acquire new skills or adapt to new environments rapidly with fewer samples through learning algorithms. Currently, my research has centered on

* **Transfer Learning**: parameter-efficient transfer learning, meta-learning
* **Multi-modal Learning**: vision-language pre-training, text-video retrieval
* **Computer Vision**: few-shot learning, compositional zero-shot learning
