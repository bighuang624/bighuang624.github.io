Hi! I am Siteng Huang (黄思腾). I am a joint Ph.D. student of [Westlake University](https://www.westlake.edu.cn/) and [Zhejiang University](http://www.zju.edu.cn/), advised by Dr. [Donglin Wang](https://en.westlake.edu.cn/about/faculty/201912/t20191206_2513.shtml). Also, I am a member of MiLAB (Machine Intelligence Laboratory) in Westlake University, where I do my research work. My research interests include meta-learning, multi-task learning and transfer learning. In particular, I am interested in technologies that allow machines and robots to complete new tasks, acquire new skills or adapt to the environment rapidly with fewer samples through learning algorithms. I am also interested in multimodal machine learning, sequence modeling and deep learning.

Before coming to Westlake University, I obtained my bachelor's degree of Engineering from [School of Computer Science](http://cs.whu.edu.cn/), [Wuhan University](https://www.whu.edu.cn/), majoring in Software Engineering.

Always open to research interns and cooperation opportunities. Feel free to reach out to me if you are interested. My email address is huangsiteng [at] westlake.edu.cn.

Currently, we are looking for **research assistants and visiting students for MiLAB**. More information about requirements for research assistants [here](https://www.westlake.edu.cn/info/1301/5559.htm), and if you are still in school, being a visiting student is also welcome. Please send email to `mi_lab [at] westlake.edu.cn` with your CV if you are interested. Specially, if you are interested in my research direction and would like to be my collaborator after coming, please let us know it from the email.
