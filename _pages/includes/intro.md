👋 Hi! I am Siteng Huang (黄思腾 in Chinese). I work at [DAMO Academy](https://damo.alibaba.com/) <a href='https://damo.alibaba.com/' target="_blank"><img src='./images/alibaba.png' align="center" style='vertical-align: middle; width: 78px;'></a> as an Algorithm Expert in Hangzhou. I received my Ph.D. degree from [Zhejiang University](http://www.zju.edu.cn/) <a href="http://www.zju.edu.cn/" target="_blank"><img src='./images/zju.png' align="center" style='vertical-align: middle; width: 19px;'></a> in June 2024, affiliated with a joint program with [Westlake University](https://www.westlake.edu.cn/) <a href="https://www.westlake.edu.cn/" target="_blank"><img src='./images/westlake.png' align="center" style='vertical-align: middle; width: 19px;'></a> at [Machine Intelligence Laboratory (MiLAB)](https://milab.westlake.edu.cn/) and advised by Prof. [Donglin Wang](https://en.westlake.edu.cn/faculty/donglin-wang.html). Before that, I received my B.Eng. Degree from School of Computer Science, [Wuhan University](https://www.whu.edu.cn/) <a href="https://www.whu.edu.cn/" target="_blank"><img src='./images/whu.png' align="center" style='vertical-align: middle; width: 19px;'></a> in June 2019.

🔬 My research has centered on the **perception, understanding, reasoning, and generation of multimodal (including images, videos, language, dynamics, etc.) data from both the internet and the physical world**. I also focus on improving the **efficiency** (in terms of data, time, parameters, memory, etc.) when building multimodal applications. I have published 20+ papers <a class='all_citation_badges' href="" target="_blank"></a> on the above topics at the top-tier international AI conferences. Recently, I devote myself to the development of multi-modal generative, embodied, and unified foundation models.

🌟 I am honored to have supervised several self-motivated visiting students and research assistants in their research and publications. If you are seeking any form of **academic cooperation**, please feel free to email me at **siteng.huang**[AT]**gmail.com** (replace [AT] with @). Additionly, I maintain close cooperation with [MiLAB]((https://milab.westlake.edu.cn/)) from Westlake University, which is actively looking for **visiting students and RAs** (please refer to [Recruitment](https://milab.westlake.edu.cn/contact.html)). Specially, if you are willing to cooperate with me there, please also send me a copy when sending your CV to the lab. Visiting students can be remote for me.
